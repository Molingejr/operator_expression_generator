    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <h2>Historical background</h2>
        The author, Molinge Lyonga Jr, started to work on this software in 2017. This software was the Molinge’s first
        real software, given to him by the University of Buea as a final year project for his Bachelor in Science in
        Computer Science. Through a few months (about 4) of rigorous dedication to this project, he came out the first
        release of the “Operator and Expression Generator” which was very productive and instrumental, though in this
        release all features intended by the Molinge has not all fully been integrated into the software given the time
        constraints that he worked on. Probably in the next release a huge advancement would have been done.
        Before we go on describing the components of the user interface. Let’s first get an overview of the system which
        is given below.
    <h2>Description of software</h2>
        This system [Operator and Expression Generator] provides a graphical user interface and a text user interface
        [for usage of some back-end functions] that allows users to carryout computations [by applying functions and/or
        constants together] to produce expressions as results. These results can also be in the intermediate[incomplete]
        form which can still be manipulated to produce the desire result or expression. Functions and Constants are
        provided or displayed on a grid table, where options for manipulating the grid’s display and structure are also
        provided along with those for creating functions/constants. Options for choosing desired operators are given on
        the interface under various categories. An operator chosen can be applied on arguments [functions/constants on
        grid] by performing some actions [like drag-and-drop, right-clicking]. There’s also a grid provided for
        intermediate results for further manipulations. The expression generated can be outputted into a file in a
        chosen format [like reverse polish, prefix, or infix notations] by means of a back-end function provided by the
        system through the Text user interface. The resulting expressions are displayed on a cell [on the grid] found
        at the intersection of the operator’s arguments [functions/constants and functions/constants on the grid].
        Repeated application of two arguments with different operators result in different expressions saved on the
        arguments intersection cell [cell is of 2D format] and provide an option for viewing this cell as a 2D format.
        The systems also provide means [file menu] of saving and loading the grid on to our application from a file in
        a unique format.
